# DOCTOR GIT

This is a simple way to manage your git information... so be sure that is not
lost in the time and space... also be sure who is the current Dr ;)

## Startup
  To start using this is so simple, you only needed two things.

### Permissions
  To execute the sh file is needed to assign it permissions, for that do the next:
```
chmod +x drgit.sh
```
  If you have troubles with the permissions try to execute it as superuser:

```
sudo chmod +x drgit.sh
```
### File Execution
Then run the file from your terminal:
```
./drgit.sh
```
Now you can use it
